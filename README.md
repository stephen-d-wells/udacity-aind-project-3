# Udacity AIND Project #3
A Monte Carlo Search Tree Implementation for the game,
Isolation.

Herein is contained a drop-in replacement for Udacity's
 *Adversarial Game Playing Agent*, the third project in 
 the 
[Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd898) 
program.

The original code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/udacity/artificial-intelligence).

This code implements a 
[Monte Carlo Search Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U&t=73s)
to play Isolation.

## Installation / Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stephen.d.wells/udacity-aind-project-3
$ cd udacity-aind-project-3
```

At this stage you need to gather up the original code which is defined as
a submodule to this one.

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cd "artificial-intelligence/Projects/3_Adversarial Search"
```

Follow the installation instructions in the submodule. Once you have it
running, copy the `my_custom_player.py` file in place and run it again with
the Monte Carlo Search Tree.

```
$ cp my_custom_player.py my_custom_player.py.bak
$ cp ../../../my_custom_player.py .
```
